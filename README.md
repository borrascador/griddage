# Griddage

## Overview

Griddage is played by two or more players taking turns 
placing a card on a 5x5 grid until the grid is filled. 
Scoring then proceeds based on cribbage rules, treating 
each row and column as a separate hand. One player scores 
the rows, the other the columns. Play continues until one 
player reaches the predetermined limit, usually 61 or 121 
points.
